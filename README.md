# Wikipedia Search app

Wikipedia search app is a freeCode camp task for the legacy front end development

The agile user stories are :

* Users can type queries in a search box and view the resulting Wikipedia entries.

* Users can view random Wikipedia articles by clicking a button.

## Relevant tools:

* wikimedia API

* Overview [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page].

* Search(query) [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Query].

### How i can achieve this:

* after going through others work on this task.

* I then decided to follow the Ayo isaiah design because i love the concept.

### Challenges encountered:

* I have challenges trying to implement the google feature of autocomplete and on keypress 

continue from the other part of the search.

* It was difficult to implement it on pure JavaScript.
